Smells:

A)

1.) Long Parameter List -->  (ChargingProfile.java)
Charging profile had a LongParameterList smell, I used the builder pattern that improved the readability, maintainability of the code. 

2.) Long Method ---> open() in MultiProtocolWebSocketListener.java
Method was very long and contained a lot of logic, making it hard to maintain. I extracted the method into
4 separate methods handling all the different aspects of WebSocket events. Now the method is a lot more shorter and readable.

3.) Complex Method ---> open() in MultiProtocolWebSocketListener.java
As stated before, method was very long but also contained a lot of responsibilities and logic, which we solved by separating the method into
different smaller methods. So both the Long Method smell and Complex Method smell very dealt with.

B)

1.) Unutilized Abstraction ---> ServerEventConfig.java

Extracted inner class 'Server Events' into a named class 'CustomerServerEvents',(SRP).
Updated the configuration class. Improved readabiliy, and usability.

2.)
